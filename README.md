# Visualizing_Nyquist_Frequency
I created this script to get a more intuitive grasp of how sampling rate will affect the way data looks. In many of the projects I've been involved with, we visualize sensor time series data with scatter plots. Adding lines to those plots adds visual noise, but this project proves that the lines are necessary to capture information your eyes would otherwise miss.
